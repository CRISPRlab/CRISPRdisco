## Welcome to CRISPRdisco

CRISPRdisco (CRISPR discovery) will identify CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays and *cas* genes in genome data sets.  The input requirements are a csv file with a column called 'Path' that is the full path to the location of your genomes of interest. If the genomes are located in the same directory as the input csv, the path is not required and you can simply use the basename of the files.


```
Usage: disco [OPTIONS] INFILE

  INFILE is a csv file with a column called "Path" that has the full path to
  the genomes of interest.  Do not include file extensions in this column.

Options:
  --workingdir TEXT       Path to working directory. Default = .
  --outdir TEXT           Path to final directory. Default = .
  --refset [full|typing]  full or subset for typing. Default = full
  --date TEXT             Date of analysis in YYYY-MM-DD format. Default is
                          today.
  --tax [no|yes|AgB]      If "yes", will merge taxonomic information. Include
                          columns titled "organism", "Taxonomic ID Kingdom",
                          "Taxonomic ID Phylum", "Taxonomic ID Class",
                          "Taxonomic ID Order", "Taxonomic ID Family",
                          "Taxonomic ID Genus". "organism" should match the
                          name of the file.
  --cas [T|F]             Perform BLAST search. Default is True
  --repeats [T|F]         Perform CRISPR repeat search. Default is True
  --summary [T|F]         Generate master summary table with type analysis.
                          Default is True.
  --dbsearch TEXT         Provide the location of a protein database
  --prot TEXT             Provide the protein to search for.
  --domains TEXT          Provide the location of an HMM domain database that
                          is already compiled
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```
 
 
 
To run the program in a docker container:
 
 1. Replace `disco` in the examples below with `./disco.sh`
 1. run from the base directory and only give relative or full paths, or preface `/home/crisprlab/` to the local path (so `./input.csv` becomes `/home/crisprlab/input.csv`), as this is where the local directory is mounted inside the container.  

 
To run the program, minimum input is:
```
disco input.csv
```
Or:
```
./disco.sh input.csv
``` 
 
where input.csv looks like:
```
,Path
0,genome
```
In your working directory, there should be two files: genome.fna and genome.faa.
 
genome.fna is a nucleotide fasta file of all of the contigs. genome.faa is the translated protein sequences from your genome in fasta format.
 
No periods can be used in the names of the sequence files! This will ruin everything!
 

## Fancy additions to CRISPRdisco:
Add taxonomic information to master table: 
```
disco --tax yes infile.csv
```
In this case, infile.csv must have columns with the following columns: â€œorganism", "Taxonomic ID Kingdom", "Taxonomic ID Phylum", "Taxonomic ID Class", "Taxonomic ID Order", "Taxonomic ID Family", "Taxonomic ID Genus". 
 
 
 
 
The default cas gene annotation looks for all cas genes. There are over 70 reference sets for all the cas proteins.  If you just want to bare minimum information for typing to speed up the pipeline, use:
```
disco --refset typing infile.csv
```
 
 
Once CRISPRdisco has identified all the cas proteins, you can perform some further analyses on them if you have databases on hand. To do these you MUST include location of database and explicitly tell the program which cas protein to search. Additionally, you must turn of the cas gene search, the repeat search, and the summary table generation. Those are done with the following flags:
```
--cas F
--repeats F
--summary F
```
 
 
 
 
You can search for your proteins in databases to see how distant they may be to known sequences. To search for found proteins in database use this code: 
```
disco --cas F --repeats F --summary F --dbsearch /dir/DB --prot cas# infile.csv
```
 
 
 
 
You can search for protein domains in your protein of choice. In order to do this, you must direct the program to a database that can be used with hmmscan (i.e. an .hmm that has already been prepared by hmmpress). Search for domains in proteins: 
```
disco --cas F --repeats F --summary F --domains /dir/DB --prot cas# infile.csv
```
 
 
 
You can also change where temporary and final output files are written to using the flags 
```
--workingdir 
```
and
```
--outdir
```
respectively.





# Installation

Use on of the following, from most to least reccomaneded



## To use docker containers:

0) On a Ubuntu or debian OS with make, git, and docker installed (either use your package manager and see https://www.docker.com/get-docker):

1) Get code: `git clone https://github.com/CRISPRlab/CRISPRdisco.git; cd CRISPRdisco`

2) Run CLI: `./disco.sh`


## To make your own docker image if the above code did not run properly:

    conda install -y -c anaconda jupyter
    conda install -y nb_conda


# Testing

After instalation, you should be able to run `disco --help` (or `./disco --help` for the docker versios
